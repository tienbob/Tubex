   - Implemented proper form validation and submission

3. **WarehouseSelector**
   - Reusable component for warehouse selection
   - Handles loading states and empty states gracefully
   - Provides consistent UI for warehouse selection across the app

4. **InventoryItemRow**
   - Reusable component for rendering inventory items
   - Implements consistent styling and behavior for inventory displays

   - Handles item actions like edit and delete

## Pending Optimizations

### Components to Refactor
1. **PriceListManagement Component**
   - Implement useReducer pattern
   - Add better state transitions

### Memoization Opportunities
1. Apply React.memo() to heavy components to prevent unnecessary re-renders
2. Optimize rendering of large lists with windowing techniques

### Additional Hooks to Consider
1. **useNotification Hook**
   - Create a standardized notification system for the application
   - Handle success, warning, error, and info notifications consistently
   - Support different notification durations and actions

2. **useDebouncedSearch Hook**
   - Implement debounced search functionality for improved performance
   - Prevent excessive API calls during user typing
   - Provide loading indicators during search operations

## Benefits of Optimizations
1. **Improved Performance**
   - Reduced unnecessary re-renders
   - More efficient state updates
   - Better memory usage

2. **Enhanced Developer Experience**
   - Cleaner and more maintainable code
   - Better type safety and error detection
   - Standardized patterns across components

3. **Better User Experience**
   - Faster UI response times
   - More consistent behavior across the application
   - Reduced bugs and edge cases

## Next Steps
1. Complete the refactoring of remaining components
2. Implement comprehensive testing for all optimized components
3. Apply memoization techniques to heavy components
4. Create additional reusable hooks for common patterns
5. Document best practices for future development
