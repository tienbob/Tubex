## Summary of Changes Made

### Issue 1: Dealer not seeing "Add Product" button
**Problem**: Dealers were not able to see the "Add Product" button because the access control was set to `productCreate: false` for all dealer roles.

**Solution**: Updated the access control permissions in `accessControl.ts`:
- `dealer-admin`: Changed `productCreate` from `false` to `true` with comment "Dealers can add supplier products to their catalog"
- `dealer-manager`: Changed `productCreate` from `false` to `true` with comment "Dealers can add supplier products to their catalog"  
- `dealer-staff`: Kept `productCreate` as `false` with comment "Staff cannot add products, only managers and admins"

### Issue 2: Users from other companies showing in User Management
**Problem**: The frontend was calling `/users` endpoint which was returning ALL users from ALL companies without proper company filtering.

**Solutions**:
1. **Frontend Fix**: Updated `userManagementService.ts` to call the correct endpoint `/company/manage` instead of `/users`
2. **Backend Security Fix**: Added proper company filtering to the `/users` endpoint in `user/controller.ts` to prevent data leakage:
   - Added company filtering: `whereCondition.company = { id: req.user.companyId }`
   - Imported `AuthenticatedRequest` type
   - Updated function signature to use `AuthenticatedRequest`

### Issue 3: Data Mismatch Investigation
**Problem**: Product shows 0 stock in ProductList but 10 pieces in InventoryList.

**Investigation**: Added debug logging to `ProductList.tsx` to see what inventory data is being received from the backend. The backend already has logic to aggregate inventory data and include it in the product response.

## Files Changed:
1. `d:\All python project\Tubex\Frontend\app\src\utils\accessControl.ts`
2. `d:\All python project\Tubex\Frontend\app\src\services\api\userManagementService.ts`
3. `d:\All python project\Tubex\Backend\src\services\user\controller.ts`
4. `d:\All python project\Tubex\Frontend\app\src\components\whitelabel\products\ProductList.tsx`

## Next Steps:
1. Test that dealers can now see the "Add Product" button and it leads to the DealerProductForm
2. Verify that User Management only shows users from the same company
3. Check the console logs to see if inventory data is being properly aggregated for products
