## AI-Assisted Development: Prompting Strategy Review

Looking back across our 30-day journey, certain AI prompting strategies consistently yielded better results than others. Here's what we learned:

### What Worked Well

1. **Context-Rich Requests**
   ```
   I'm working on the OrderManagement component for our Tubex platform. The component needs to display a list of orders with real-time status updates, allow filtering by multiple criteria, and handle batch operations. Here's our current data model:
   
   [data model code]
   
   How should we design this component with performance and usability in mind?
   ```
   
   Providing rich context about our specific use case, constraints, and existing code allowed the AI to provide highly relevant solutions tailored to our application.

2. **Incremental Development**
   ```
   Now that we have the basic OrderManagement component working, how should we add batch processing capabilities that let users select multiple orders and apply actions like "mark as shipped" or "generate invoices"?
   ```
   
   Building features incrementally through successive prompts led to more coherent and manageable code than trying to generate complex functionality all at once.

3. **Alternative Approaches**
   ```
   We're considering two approaches for implementing our analytics dashboard:
   1. Client-side data processing with React-Query and Recharts
   2. Server-side processing with pre-aggregated data and minimal client rendering
   
   What are the trade-offs of each approach for our specific case of construction material dealers who need to view inventory turnover and sales patterns?
   ```
   
   Asking the AI to weigh different approaches led to more thoughtful solutions and helped us make better architectural decisions.

4. **Domain-Specific Solutions**
   ```
   In the construction materials business in Vietnam, how would you recommend we design the inventory tracking system to account for common industry challenges like partial deliveries, material batches with different properties, and regional pricing variations?
   ```
   
   Prompts that included industry-specific context yielded solutions that were better aligned with our users' actual needs and workflows.

### What Could Have Been Better

1. **Overly Generic Requests**
   ```
   BEFORE: How do we implement authentication?
   
   AFTER: We need to implement authentication for our B2B platform with these requirements:
   1. Multiple user roles (admin, manager, staff)
   2. Company-based access controls where users can only see their company's data
   3. SSO integration with Google Workspace
   4. Support for API keys for system integration
   
   Here's our current user model: [code]
   ```
   
   Generic requests often led to generic solutions that required significant rework to fit our specific needs.

2. **Missing Context About Tech Stack**
   ```
   BEFORE: How do we optimize database queries for the order listing page?
   
   AFTER: We're using PostgreSQL 14 with TypeORM in a Node.js environment. Our order listing page is showing poor performance when filtering across these related tables: [table definitions]. How can we optimize these specific queries: [queries]
   ```
   
   Without specific technology context, AI suggestions sometimes didn't align with our stack.

3. **Unclear Requirements**
   ```
   BEFORE: Make our dashboard better.
   
   AFTER: Our analytics dashboard needs to load faster and provide more actionable insights. Specifically:
   1. Initial load time needs to improve (currently 3.2s, target <1s)
   2. Add predictive inventory alerts based on historical sales patterns
   3. Make charts exportable to PDF and Excel formats
   ```
   
   Vague requirements led to solutions that didn't address our actual needs.

## Key Architecture Decisions

Throughout our development journey, several key architectural decisions shaped the Tubex platform:

### 1. Multi-Tenant Architecture

With the AI's guidance, we implemented a hybrid multi-tenancy approach:

```typescript
// tenantMiddleware.ts (simplified)
export const tenantMiddleware = async (req: Request, res: Response, next: NextFunction) => {
  try {
    // Extract tenant identifier from subdomain or custom header
    const hostname = req.hostname;
    const tenantId = req.headers['x-tenant-id'] || hostname.split('.')[0];
    
    // Get tenant configuration from cache first
    const cachedTenant = await redisClient.get(`tenant:${tenantId}`);
    
    if (cachedTenant) {
      req.tenant = JSON.parse(cachedTenant);
    } else {
      // Fetch from database if not cached
      const tenant = await getRepository(Tenant).findOne({ 
        where: { identifier: tenantId },
        relations: ['configuration', 'theme']
      });
      
      if (!tenant) {
        return res.status(404).json({ error: 'Tenant not found' });
      }
      
      req.tenant = tenant;
      
      // Cache tenant data
      await redisClient.set(
        `tenant:${tenantId}`, 
        JSON.stringify(tenant),
        'EX',
        3600 // 1 hour
      );
    }
    
    // Set database schema for tenant
    if (req.tenant.databaseStrategy === 'schema') {
      await setTenantSchema(req.tenant.schemaName);
    }
    
    next();
  } catch (error) {
    next(error);
  }
};
```

This approach gives us flexibility to support both SMB dealers (with shared infrastructure) and enterprise clients (with dedicated resources) in the future.

### 2. Event-Driven Communication

For system integration and real-time updates, we implemented an event-driven architecture:

```typescript
// orderService.ts (simplified)
export class OrderService {
  // Other methods...
  
  async createOrder(orderData: CreateOrderDto): Promise<Order> {
    const orderRepository = getRepository(Order);
    const order = orderRepository.create(orderData);
    
    // Save to database
    const savedOrder = await orderRepository.save(order);
    
    // Publish event for other services
    await eventBus.publish('order.created', {
      orderId: savedOrder.id,
      companyId: savedOrder.companyId,
      products: savedOrder.items.map(item => ({
        productId: item.productId,
        quantity: item.quantity
      }))
    });
    
    return savedOrder;
  }
}
```

This architecture has already proven valuable for features like real-time inventory updates and notifications.

### 3. Micro-Frontend Approach

With the AI's guidance, we adopted a micro-frontend architecture for our dashboard:

```typescript
// DashboardShell.tsx
import React, { lazy, Suspense } from 'react';
import { ErrorBoundary } from 'react-error-boundary';
import { LoadingSpinner, ErrorFallback } from '../components/common';

// Micro-frontends loaded dynamically
const InventoryDashboard = lazy(() => import('./modules/inventory/InventoryDashboard'));
const SalesDashboard = lazy(() => import('./modules/sales/SalesDashboard'));
const FinanceDashboard = lazy(() => import('./modules/finance/FinanceDashboard'));

interface DashboardShellProps {
  activeDashboard: 'inventory' | 'sales' | 'finance';
}

export const DashboardShell: React.FC<DashboardShellProps> = ({ activeDashboard }) => {
  const renderDashboard = () => {
    switch (activeDashboard) {
      case 'inventory':
        return <InventoryDashboard />;
      case 'sales':
        return <SalesDashboard />;
      case 'finance':
        return <FinanceDashboard />;
      default:
        return <div>Select a dashboard module</div>;
    }
  };

  return (
    <ErrorBoundary FallbackComponent={ErrorFallback}>
      <Suspense fallback={<LoadingSpinner />}>
        {renderDashboard()}
      </Suspense>
    </ErrorBoundary>
  );
};
```

This approach allows individual teams to work on different modules independently, which will be crucial as our development team grows.

## AI-Assisted Development: Lessons for Future Projects

After 30 days of working with AI assistance, here are our key takeaways for future projects:

1. **AI as an Accelerator, Not a Replacement**
   
   AI significantly accelerated our development, but the most successful outcomes came when we used it as a collaborative tool rather than attempting to outsource entire components to it.

2. **Knowledge Transfer is Bidirectional**
   
   We learned from the AI's suggestions, and it learned from our feedback and corrections. This iterative learning process improved results over time.

3. **Domain Knowledge Remains Crucial**
   
   The most valuable AI contributions came when we provided rich domain context about the construction materials industry in Vietnam.

4. **Documentation Quality Impacts AI Assistance Quality**
   
   Our investment in comprehensive documentation (BRD, TDD, component specs) paid off in better AI assistance.

5. **Component-Based Prompting Works Better**
   
   Breaking development into component-level tasks with clear boundaries resulted in better AI assistance than tackling entire pages or systems at once.

## Conclusion

The 30-day development sprint for Tubex has transformed our vision into a functional B2B SaaS platform ready to disrupt the construction materials distribution industry in Vietnam. Through AI-assisted development, we've achieved in one month what might traditionally take a quarter or more.

The combination of human domain expertise and AI assistance proved especially powerful in areas like architecture design, component development, and testing. As we move forward with the next phases of development, we'll continue to refine our AI collaboration techniques while focusing on the specific needs of our users in the construction materials sector.

We're excited about the road ahead and grateful for the AI assistance that has accelerated our journey thus far. The future of Tubex looks promising as we work to digitalize and streamline the construction materials supply chain throughout Vietnam and, eventually, Southeast Asia.
