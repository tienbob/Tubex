# Setting Up a Production-Ready Backend with AI Assistance: Tubex Case Study

## Introduction

While developing the Tubex B2B SaaS platform, we discovered effective patterns for using AI to accelerate backend development setup. This blog shares our practical experience in setting up a Node.js/TypeScript backend with AI assistance.

## Initial Project Structure

### 1. Effective AI Prompting for Project Setup

✅ **Good Prompt Example:**
```
"Create a TypeScript Node.js backend project structure for a B2B SaaS platform with:
- Multi-tenant architecture
- PostgreSQL with TypeORM
- JWT authentication
- Role-based access control
- API rate limiting
- Request validation
Include the key files and configurations needed."
```

❌ **Ineffective Prompt:**
```
"Help me setup Node.js backend"
```

### 2. Iterative Development with AI

We broke down the setup into focused tasks:

1. **Base Configuration**
```typescript
// First Prompt: "Setup TypeScript configuration for Node.js backend with strict type checking"
// AI Generated base tsconfig.json which we then customized:
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "target": "es2020",
    "module": "commonjs",
    "rootDir": "./src",
    "outDir": "./dist",
    "strict": true,
    "esModuleInterop": true,
    "skipLibCheck": true
  }
}
```

2. **Project Structure**
After getting the initial structure, we refined it with specific prompts:

```
Backend/
├── src/
│   ├── config/        # Configuration management
│   ├── database/      # Database connections
│   ├── services/      # Business logic
│   ├── middleware/    # Custom middleware
│   └── server.ts      # Entry point
```

## Real Examples from Tubex Development

### 1. Database Setup

**AI Prompt Used:**
```
"Create a TypeORM configuration for PostgreSQL with:
- Multi-tenant support
- Connection pooling
- Migration support
Include error handling and connection retry logic"
```

**Result (After Review):**
```typescript
// filepath: src/database/ormconfig.ts
import { DataSource } from 'typeorm';
import { config } from '../config';

export const AppDataSource = new DataSource({
  type: 'postgres',
  host: config.db.host,
  port: config.db.port,
  username: config.db.username,
  password: config.db.password,
  database: config.db.database,
  entities: ['src/entities/**/*.ts'],
  migrations: ['src/migrations/**/*.ts'],
  poolSize: 10,
  connectTimeoutMS: 3000,
  retryAttempts: 3
});
```

### 2. Authentication Middleware

**AI Prompt:**
```
"Generate JWT authentication middleware with:
- Token validation
- Role-based access control
- Multi-tenant context handling
Include error handling for expired tokens and invalid signatures"
```

### 3. Request Validation

**AI Prompt:**
```
"Create request validation middleware using Joi for:
- User registration
- Product creation
- Order processing
Include detailed error messages and type definitions"
```

## Best Practices We Discovered

1. **Break Down Complex Setups**
   - Request one component at a time
   - Review and integrate before moving on
   - Maintain consistency across generated code

2. **Iterative Refinement**
   ```
   Initial Request → Review → Specific Improvements → Final Implementation
   ```

3. **Security Focus**
   - Always request security best practices
   - Validate AI-generated security implementations
   - Include error handling and logging

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. **Over-Reliance on Generated Code**
   - Always review for security implications
   - Test edge cases
   - Validate business logic

2. **Missing Context**
   - Provide project-specific requirements
   - Include performance expectations
   - Specify error handling needs

## Results and Metrics

- Setup time reduced by 60%
- Better code consistency
- Fewer initial bugs
- More comprehensive error handling

## Conclusion

AI is particularly effective for backend setup when used methodically:
1. Clear, specific prompts
2. Iterative development
3. Consistent review and validation
4. Focus on security and scalability

The key is finding the right balance between AI assistance and human oversight, especially for critical components like authentication and data access.
