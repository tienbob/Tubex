Project Evaluation and Roadmap Report
Current Implementation Assessment
After reviewing the codebase, I can see that the Tubex application has implemented several important components of the required modules, but there are significant gaps that need to be addressed.

What's Already Implemented
Sales Management Module:
✅ Order Management: Comprehensive order tracking system with status updates (OrderManagement.tsx)
✅ Product Management: Basic product creation and management (ProductManagement.tsx)
✅ Inventory Management: Well-developed inventory tracking with warehouse management (InventoryManagement.tsx, InventoryList.tsx)
✅ Warehouse Management: Comprehensive warehouse system with inventory allocation (WarehouseManagement.tsx)
✅ Basic Reporting: Dashboard with high-level metrics for orders, products, and inventory (Dashboard.tsx)
What's Missing
Sales Management Module:
❌ Quote Management: No quote creation/tracking system
❌ Invoice Management: No invoice generation or tracking
❌ Price List Management: No system for managing multiple price lists
❌ Comprehensive Payment Management: Basic payment status exists, but no full payment tracking
❌ Discount Management: References exist in order code but no dedicated management system
❌ Customer Management: No dedicated customer database or relationship tools
❌ Employee Management: Limited user management without role-based sales functions
❌ Advanced Analytics: Basic reporting exists but lacks sales-specific analytics
Accounts Receivable/Payable Module:
❌ Debt Tracking: No system for tracking customer/supplier debts
❌ Debt Warnings and Reminders: No alert system for upcoming or overdue payments
❌ Debt Reports: No financial reporting for accounts receivable/payable
❌ Payment Tracking: No comprehensive system for tracking payments and balances
