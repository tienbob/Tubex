# SERVICE FIXES APPLIED: Multi-Tenant Security & Model Updates

## Summary

Following the critical data model fixes, all related services have been systematically updated to properly handle the new company relationships and enforce strict multi-tenant security. This document details all the service modifications applied.

## üîß SERVICES UPDATED

### 1. **Inventory Service - UPDATED**
**File**: `Backend/src/services/inventory/controller.ts`

#### Critical Fixes Applied:
- ‚úÖ **Batch Creation**: Added `company_id` field when creating initial batches
- ‚úÖ **Stock Adjustment**: Added `company_id` field when creating adjustment batches  
- ‚úÖ **Expiring Batches**: Updated query to filter by `batch.company_id` instead of `warehouse.company_id`
- ‚úÖ **Security**: All batch operations now include proper company context

#### Code Changes:
```typescript
// BEFORE: Missing company context
initialBatch.warehouse_id = warehouse_id;
initialBatch.quantity = quantity;

// AFTER: Proper company isolation
initialBatch.warehouse_id = warehouse_id;
initialBatch.company_id = companyId; // CRITICAL FIX
initialBatch.quantity = quantity;
```

### 2. **Inventory Validation Service - UPDATED**
**File**: `Backend/src/services/inventory/validation.ts`

#### Critical Fixes Applied:
- ‚úÖ **Batch Validation**: Added `companyId` parameter for multi-tenant batch validation
- ‚úÖ **Security**: Batch queries now filter by `company_id` to prevent cross-company access
- ‚úÖ **Interface**: Updated `InventoryValidationService` interface to include company context

#### Code Changes:
```typescript
// BEFORE: No company filtering
const batch = await manager.findOne(Batch, {
    where: { batch_number: batchNumber }
});

// AFTER: Multi-tenant filtering
const batch = await manager.findOne(Batch, {
    where: { 
        batch_number: batchNumber,
        company_id: companyId // CRITICAL FIX
    }
});
```

### 3. **Payment Service - UPDATED**
**File**: `Backend/src/services/payment/controller.ts`

#### Critical Fixes Applied:
- ‚úÖ **Payment Creation**: Added company context determination and validation
- ‚úÖ **Payment Queries**: All payment queries now filter by `companyId`
- ‚úÖ **Security**: Added cross-company access prevention
- ‚úÖ **Company Assignment**: Automatic company assignment based on order/invoice context

#### Code Changes:
```typescript
// BEFORE: No company context
const payment = new Payment();
payment.customerId = customerId;
payment.amount = amount;

// AFTER: Proper company isolation
const payment = new Payment();
payment.customerId = customerId;
payment.companyId = companyId; // CRITICAL FIX
payment.amount = amount;

// BEFORE: No company filtering in queries
const whereClause: FindOptionsWhere<Payment> = {};
if (orderId) whereClause.orderId = orderId;

// AFTER: Always filter by company
const whereClause: FindOptionsWhere<Payment> = {};
whereClause.companyId = req.user.companyId; // CRITICAL FIX
if (orderId) whereClause.orderId = orderId;
```

### 4. **NEW: Batch Service - CREATED**
**Files**: 
- `Backend/src/services/batch/controller.ts` (NEW)
- `Backend/src/services/batch/routes.ts` (NEW)

#### Features Implemented:
- ‚úÖ **Complete CRUD Operations**: Create, Read, Update, Delete batches
- ‚úÖ **Multi-Tenant Security**: All operations filtered by company
- ‚úÖ **Batch Statistics**: Company-specific batch analytics
- ‚úÖ **Advanced Filtering**: By warehouse, product, expiry dates
- ‚úÖ **Data Validation**: Warehouse ownership, product access rights
- ‚úÖ **Audit Trail**: User tracking in metadata

#### Key Security Features:
```typescript
// Company access validation for all operations
if (!BatchService.checkCompanyAccess(req, companyId)) {
    throw new AppError(403, "Unauthorized access to company data");
}

// Always filter queries by company
.where('batch.company_id = :companyId', { companyId })

// Validate warehouse belongs to company
const warehouse = await warehouseRepository.findOne({
    where: { id: warehouse_id, company_id: companyId }
});
```

## üîí SECURITY ENHANCEMENTS

### Multi-Tenant Isolation
- **Before**: Batch operations had no company filtering
- **After**: All batch operations strictly filtered by `company_id`
- **Impact**: Prevents horizontal privilege escalation

### Payment Security
- **Before**: Payments lacked company context
- **After**: Payments automatically inherit company from orders/invoices
- **Impact**: Proper audit trail and access control

### Validation Security
- **Before**: Batch validation could access any company's batches
- **After**: Batch validation requires company context
- **Impact**: Prevents cross-company data validation

## üìä BUSINESS LOGIC IMPROVEMENTS

### Batch Management
- Unique batch numbers per company (not globally)
- Proper inventory-batch relationship tracking
- Expiry date management and alerts
- Manufacturing date tracking

### Payment Processing
- Automatic company context determination
- Order/Invoice relationship validation
- Multi-company payment reporting capability

### Inventory Operations
- Enhanced batch tracking for stock movements
- Proper FIFO/LIFO support foundation
- Company-isolated batch expiry monitoring

## üöÄ API ENDPOINTS ADDED

### Batch Management Endpoints
```
POST   /api/batch/company/{companyId}                 - Create batch
GET    /api/batch/company/{companyId}                 - List batches
GET    /api/batch/company/{companyId}/{batchId}       - Get batch details
PUT    /api/batch/company/{companyId}/{batchId}       - Update batch
DELETE /api/batch/company/{companyId}/{batchId}       - Deactivate batch
GET    /api/batch/company/{companyId}/stats           - Batch statistics
```

### Enhanced Query Parameters
- `warehouse_id` - Filter by warehouse
- `product_id` - Filter by product  
- `status` - Filter by status (active/inactive/expired)
- `expiring_days` - Filter batches expiring within N days
- `page` & `limit` - Pagination support

## ‚ö° PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATIONS

### Database Queries
- Added proper indexes for multi-tenant queries
- Optimized batch expiry queries
- Efficient pagination for large datasets

### Query Patterns
```sql
-- BEFORE: Inefficient join-based filtering
WHERE warehouse.company_id = ?

-- AFTER: Direct column filtering with index
WHERE batch.company_id = ? 
```

## üß™ VALIDATION UPDATES

### Required Updates for Existing Code
1. **Batch Validation Calls**: Add `companyId` parameter
```typescript
// BEFORE
await inventoryValidation.validateBatchAvailability(batchNumber, quantity);

// AFTER  
await inventoryValidation.validateBatchAvailability(batchNumber, quantity, companyId);
```

2. **Payment Creation**: Ensure company context is provided
3. **Inventory Operations**: Use updated batch creation with company context
